-No one talks to my ass.
-My asshole says shit.
-We get talked to by lots of other people.
My new album is on sale on my Bandcamp and you can also hear me on my SoundCloud.
I write and record this stuff mostly by myself.
The next full length album should be out this spring.
I'm also working on a couple of other projects: A comedy short film called "How to Start a Riot" with my friend John Meehan (who will also be starring in the film) and "No Way Out With My Ass!"
In the meantime I can be found recording songs at the bar at the Northside Club in Austin, TX every now and then and I'll be coming by to play/record in March, April, and May of this year.
There's also a couple of tours coming up in April (see my tour dates at the bottom of this page) which I'm super excited to get going, I hope you'll be seeing me!
